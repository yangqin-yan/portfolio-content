            YOASOBI appeared for the first time in the 71st NHK Red
            and White Song Festival as a singer in the red group, 
            the group has not yet released a record, it is an exception 
            to participate in the Red and White, and this is also their 
            first time to sing on TV.

            Red and White Song Festival is an annual New Year's Eve television 
            special produced by Japanese public broadcaster NHK. It is broadcast 
            live simultaneously on television and radio, nationally and internationally 
            by the NHK network and by some overseas (mainly cable) broadcasters who buy
            the program. The show ends shortly before midnight. Before the show began
              broadcasting on television in late 1953, the show was held on 3 January 
              and only consisted of a radio broadcast.

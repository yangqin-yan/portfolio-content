        YOASOBI appeared for the first time in the 71st NHK Red
         and White Song Festival as a singer in the red group, 
         the group has not yet released a record, it is an exception 
         to participate in the Red and White, and this is also their 
         first time to sing on TV.

        Red and White Song Festival is an annual New Year's Eve television 
        special produced by Japanese public broadcaster NHK. It is broadcast 
        live simultaneously on television and radio, nationally and internationally 
        by the NHK network and by some overseas (mainly cable) broadcasters who buy
         the program. The show ends shortly before midnight. Before the show began
          broadcasting on television in late 1953, the show was held on 3 January 
          and only consisted of a radio broadcast.

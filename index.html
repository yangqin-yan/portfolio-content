        The name "YOASOBI" originates from the Japanese word 夜遊び, 
        meaning "nightlife". Ayase, who is a producer of the group said he
         named it as a wish that he could take on various playful challenges 
         by comparing the appearance of acting as an individual to the appearance 
         of daytime and the appearance of two people acting as YOASOBI as the 
         appearance of the night.
